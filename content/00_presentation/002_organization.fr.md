During this workshop, the session will be divided into two distinct parts, each spanning one hour. The first segment will delve into Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), while the second part will focus on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS). Participants will be segregated into virtual rooms corresponding to these segments, facilitating a more focused learning experience. Throughout the session, participants will have the opportunity to pose questions to the moderator by accessing the BlueJeans platform and clicking on the designated button for live queries and discussions. This setup aims to ensure an interactive and informative session, allowing participants to engage deeply with the material and seek clarification as needed.
