Your goal will be to Facilitate Scale and Security for Your OpenShift Clusters with OpenShift Platform Plus through immersive exploration. 

Dive into Advanced Cluster Management (ACM), where you'll diagnose resource constraints, refine placement rules for multi-cloud deployment, and delve into the world of GitOps, automating deployments to proactively address issues akin to real incident resolution scenarios.

In the subsequent Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) segment, your aim will pivot towards conquering security challenges. You'll navigate interfaces to manage CVEs, craft responsive security policies, and detect attack flows. Engage fully in a DevSecOps process, identifying, resolving, and refining deployment methodologies, ensuring heightened robustness for your applications.
