For the rest of this Lab, you will work in pair programming.
With your team members, pair up and assign roles!

* Duo **A** is in charge of implementing the code on ESP8266 to scan the **incoming** parcels using RFID and send the data over MQTT.
* Duo **B** is in charge of implementing the code on ESP8266 to scan the **outgoing** parcels using RFID and send the data over MQTT.
* Duo **C** is in charge of setting up Kafka Broker and implementing the Camel-K integration.

At the end, you should have three pairs (or duos).

**Tip**: On your name tent, write your duo's name (**A**, **B** or **C**)!

Now, pick up the tasks assigned to your duo in the left menu!
