During this workshop, the session will be divided into two distinct parts, each lasting one hour. The first segment will look at Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), while the second part will focus on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS).

Participants will be divided into virtual rooms. Throughout the session, participants will have the opportunity to ask questions of the moderator.

This setup aims to ensure an interactive and informative session, allowing participants to ask for clarification if necessary.
